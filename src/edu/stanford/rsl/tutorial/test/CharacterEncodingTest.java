 * This is a test case to check whether the character encoding of your eclipse project is correctly configured.
 * If you get an error compiling this file, you need to set your character encoding to "UTF8".
 * To do this right click the top source folder "src" and select properties. In the "resource" tab, in text file encoding select
 * "other" and set it to "UTF-8". This value will then be inherited to all source sub-folders.
